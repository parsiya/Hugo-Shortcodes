<!-- relref helper for my blog

    Note: This adds text to the input params to create a relref link for my
    blog. It adds hardcoded strings to the path to work with the way I organize
    my paths. It might not be useful for you.

    My posts are in /post/year/yyyy-mm-dd-name-of-post/index.markdown so this
    helps make my markdown documents easier to read.

    Anchor is optional. No need to include "#" but if included it will not
    introduce a bug. The shortcode trims it and adds its own.
    Path is passed to the relref link so it will panic if the path does not exist.
    Title is also optional. If not provided, the actual link will be the title.
    I.e., .Site.BaseURL/$relreflink.

<!-- support for both named and positional arguments. -->

{{ $title := "" }}
{{ $path := "" }}
{{ $anchor := "" }}

{{ if .IsNamedParams }}
  <!-- named version -->
  {{ $title = .Get "title" }}
  {{ $path = .Get "path" }}
  {{ $anchor = .Get "anchor" }}
{{ else }}
  <!-- positional version -->
  {{ $title = .Get 0 }}
  {{ $path = .Get 1 }}
  {{ $anchor = .Get 2 }}
{{ end }}

<!-- remove "/" from beginning and ending from post's path (if any).
    Now, we don't care if we have included them in the params or not. -->
{{ $path := trim $path "/" }}

<!-- add "/index.markdown" to the end -->
{{ $path = print $path "/index.markdown" }}

<!-- check if anchor exists, if so add # to the beginning and concat with path -->
{{ if ne $anchor "" }}
  <!-- trim # from the beginning (if any) so we do not need to worry if it's
  already there -->
  {{ $path = print $path "#" (trim $anchor "#") }}
{{ end }}

<!-- now pass it to the relref function -->
{{ $relreflink := relref . $path }}

<!-- if title does not exist, use {{.Site.BaseURL}}{{$relreflink}} as title -->
{{ if eq $title "" }}
  {{ $title = print .Site.BaseURL $relreflink }}
{{ end }}

<!-- the final link should look like this -->
<!-- <a href="path-from-relref" title="title" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">title</a> -->
<a href="{{ $relreflink }}" title="{{ $title }}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">{{ $title }}</a>
